    "Ok, there's a lot going on here. Let's break these different things down a bit.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Array Type:** The very first thing that is shown in the above print out is 'xarray.Dataset'. There are two main types of arrays that xarray can handle: DataArrays and Datasets. A Dataset is a collection of DataArrays. Imagine that a DataArray is a rubix cube. It is a 3D (or 2D or 4D or however shaped) array of data. A Dataset would therefore be a collection of rubix cubes. Imagine you ordered a shipment of 30 rubix cubes. Each individual rubix cube is a DataArray, and the box that all the cubes were shipped in is the Dataset. We can select one DataArray using its variable name. There are some data selection methods that only work on DataArrays, which is why it is important to distinguish between DataArrays and Datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimensions:** The dimensions are the directions that the file has, or the names of the axes. There are four dimensions listed in this file: time, x, y, and nbnds. Since this is meteorological data, we can think of these as latitudes or rows and longitudes or columns. There are 277 y, which means there are 277 lines of latitude in the grid. There are 349 x, or 349 lines of longitude. The time dimension has 366 values. We selected daily means over a year, and 2020 is a leap year so 366 total days.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Coordinates:** Coordinates are labels for each step of a dimension. This particular file has three of the same coords as in dims: x, y, and time. However, nbnds is not in the coord list, and now there are lat and lon coords. Next to each coord is the number and name of the dimensions in that coord. Time, x, and y only have one dimension and those dimensions have the same name. Click on the piece of paper next to each of these coordinates. What does it say? In comparison, lat and lon have two dimensions: (y,x). This is because any point on a map will have a unique latitude and longitude combination. Each grid point in this Dataset will also have a unique latitude and longitude combination, which is made up of x and y values. "

    "**Data Variables:** These are the variables of interest. This is the actual data in your file. For example, there is \"hpbl\" that might be of interest to us. In some Datasets, the data variables have unusual names, which can make understanding the data difficult. Xarray is great because it allows you to have metadata for each data variable, which might help to explain the data a little more. Click on the picture of a piece of paper next to the \"hpbl\" variable name. What does it say? Some of the data variables have useful metadata under this piece of paper.    \n",
    "Next, click on the picture of 3 stacked circles beside a data variable. What should appear is an array of the data. These are the actual values of this data variable.  \n",

    "**Indexes:** Indexes are not always in an Xarray Dataset. Dimensions and coords are more useful in Xarray than the indexes, but you might find Datasets that include them. In this case, it is the three dimensions of the data (x,y, time) with a pandas Series of the values for each dimension that is listed in the coords. \n",
    "\n",
