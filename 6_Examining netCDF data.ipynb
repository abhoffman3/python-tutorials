    "Ok, there's a lot going on here. Let's break these different things down a bit.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Array Type:** The very first thing that is shown in the above print out is 'xarray.Dataset'. There are two types of arrays that xarray can handle: DataArrays and Datasets. A Dataset is a collection of DataArrays. Imagine that a DataArray is a rubix cube. It is a 3D (or 2D or 4D or however shaped) array of data. A Dataset would therefore be a collection of rubix cubes. Imagine you ordered a shipment of 30 rubix cubes. Each individual rubix cube is a DataArray, and the box that all the cubes were shipped in is the Dataset. We can select one DataArray using its variable name. There are some data selection methods that only work on DataArrays, which is why it is important to distinguish between DataArrays and Datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimensions:** The dimensions are the directions that the file has, or the names of the axes. There are four dimensions listed in this file: lat, lon, rbg, and eightbitcolor. Since this is satellite data, we can think of these as latitudes or rows and longitudes or columns. There are 4320 rows, which means there are 4320 lines of latitude in the grid. There are 8640 columns, or 8640 lines of longitude. The rgb dimension is 3, meaning that there are 3 primary colors used to design the satellite image. Think like the 3 colors used to light up TV or computer screen pixels. Finally, there is eightbitcolor dimension. This is from the 8 bit color storage method, which is a way of storing image information in a computer. Both rgb and eightbitcolor are used in the palette Data variable to tell us how to color the satellite image.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Coordinates:** Coordinates are labels for each step of a dimension. This particular file has two coords: lat and lon. Each step in the lat coord has a new value (the latitude coordinate on a map), and each step in the lon coord has a new value (the longitude coordinate on a map).  "

In some datasets, the data variables have unusual names, which can make understanding the data difficult. xarray is great because it allows you to have metadata for each data variable, which might help to explain the data a little more. Click on the picture of a piece of paper next to the \"chlor-a\" variable name. What does it say? Some of the data variables have useful metadata under this piece of paper.    \n",

So averaging along axis=0 would give us the average in time (4320 x 8640 grid). Lat became axis=1, and we know that latitude is the y-axis in real life. Lon became axis=2, and we know that longitude is the x-axis in real like. So to find the mean of the rows, we need to average along the longitudes, or along axis=2. To find the mean of the columns, we average along the latitudes, or along axis=1."
